I designed the logo for Piefingers, the artist also known as Emily Loydall. The idea was to create something minimal, which also reflected and communicated the multi-coloured, multi-disciplinary & multi-subject approach to her work. I used a multi-coloured pastel sketch of hers as a reference point for the colour sequence. And we chose the [Lato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lato_(typeface) ) font (designed by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic), a summery sans-serif typeface family, for its harmonious lines and sleek, classical proportions. 

I also designed the layout and branding for her notebooks, business & thank you cards and other assorted stationery. The idea across all her printed collateral was to create unobtrusive, though memorable branding, which complements without intruding upon the work.
