This is just a very minimal image slideshow with thumbnail toggle built using HTML, CSS and jQuery. Design inspired by cargocollective.com  

The idea here was to use clean code (removing all unnecessary fluff) to create an intuitive user experience, whereby the content *dictates the design*. This is an unusually rare approach to image display, as most contemporary slideshows use icons, lightboxes and / or scrolling thumbnails to navigate images. I personally find the combination of text navigation alongside thumbnail indexes to make for a more graceful user experience.  

The code for the responsive size of the image is based on a calculation I adapted from the toddhido.com website. It uses window width and height as a reference for the relative size of the image.
