# ABOUT ME

Junior Web Developer & Designer based in Largs, Scotland  
Email me here: <nickantonyh@gmail.com>  
Call me on +447751435710

I've worked as an independent web developer since 2008, specializing in WordPress
and Joomla. The majority of the projects I've delivered have been carried out on a subcontractual
basis, and I've tended to work from home, to minimize overhead costs. 

I take a highly personable approach towards my clients and my work. I work on the basis of
simplicity and efficiency, minimizing the expenditure of unnecessary energy.
