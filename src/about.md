# ABOUT ME

Junior Web Developer based in Largs, Scotland  
Email me here: <nickantonyh@gmail.com>

I've worked as an independent web developer since 2008, specializing in WordPress
and Joomla. The majority of the projects I've delivered have been carried out on a subcontractual
basis, and I've tended to work from home, to minimize overhead costs. 

I take a highly personable approach towards my clients and my work. I work on the basis of
simplicity and efficiency, minimizing the expenditure of unnecessary energy.  

My projects are tailored to meet the specific needs of my clients. I do not spend inordinate amounts
of time theorizing and brainstorming solutions; I assess the needs of the client, factor in the budget, select the most
suitable system, and build. I then tune, test and iterate, according to the brief supplied, and according to what I see as
the best fit for each client.
